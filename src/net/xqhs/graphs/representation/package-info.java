/**
 * This package contains classes that implement various manners of representation for graphs.
 * <p>
 * These representations are mostly based on creating a linear form of the graph.
 * <p>
 * The basic interface for a graph representation is <code>GraphRepresentation</code>, and 
 * <code>RepresentationElement</code> is used as interface for the representation of an individual graph element.
